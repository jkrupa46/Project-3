    <img src="images/gta.png" alt="Grand Theft Auto 5">
    <p>Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a first-person or third-person view. Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series. It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.</p>

    <img src="images/csgo.jpg" alt="Counter Strike: Global Offensive">
    <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. The gameplay in Global Offensive is similar to that of previous games in the Counter-Strike series in the sense that it is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Players play as one of two teams; the Terrorists or the Counter Terrorists, with both teams having different objectives: the Terrorists' being to plant the bomb and have it explode or to protect the hostages, and the Counter-Terrorists' being to prevent the bomb from being planted and exploding, or to rescue the aforementioned hostages, depending on the map. At the start of every round players get the opportunity to purchase weapons and equipment with their money that is awarded based on their performance in the previous round. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players results in more money. Negative actions, such as killing teammates, will result in a penalty.</p>
